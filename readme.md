MyTimer
=======

by Adrian Withy

A dirt-simple timer that does what I need.  Not intended to be any sort of example of quality development ;)


**Commands:**

**S** - start (default 40 minutes)

**P** - pause

To set the time type the number of minutes and hit start ('S').  Example: to set a timer for 15 minutes type '1', '5', 'S'.
